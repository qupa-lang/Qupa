A compiled programming language based around having individual queues for each thread allowing event and callback driven multithreading behaviour.

## Setup
First you need do install Clang and NPM, both of which are operating system specific.
<details>
	<summary>Unix</summary>
	On unix installation is quite easy. Just run the two lines below in your terminal
<pre><code>sudo apt-get npm<br>
sudo apt-get clang++</code></pre>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Windows</summary>
	First simply install NodeJS from <a href="https://nodejs.dev">nodejs.dev</a>, then you need to install clang. To install Clang one Windows you need to have MSVC installed first - to do this follow this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation">guide</a>, then once MSVC is installed you can simply download the pre-built binary for you computer from <a href="https://releases.llvm.org/download.html">here</a>
</details>

Once that is done, simply run these lines in the folder and now all required files are prepared for your system
```
npm install @qupa/qupa
```

## CLI Ussage
Once you have followed the setup, NPM has registered ``qupa`` as a command that can be used to compile with.
```
qupa {entry_file}
```
